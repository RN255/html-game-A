# html-game-A

creating a html game

- to do list
- get prettier working
- you could change the number to start at zero or increase the random...

  - no it is fine!

- fog of war...?
- improve computer AI
- limit of set start location of units...
- give units range...
- dont have a fog of war... just reveal the location of the tank for a moment after it shoots...
- reset not working properly if it is the computer tanks turn...
- this would be a lot easier with classes!
- need unique explosions for when my units are hit
- some things dont reset when we press reset, the enemy tank respawns
- the computer keeps attacking his own units, and i can do it to...

- GAME STYLE 1 - shoot and scoot

  - artillery is hidden then revealed when it fires
  - kill the artillery to win
  - the scout doesnt die but can be used to try and find the artillery, if within range it will be seen

    - problems - the computer tank is moving on top of me

    - computer cannot read minus class numbers are runs an error, needs fixing

    -- remember that stupid tank keeps appearing even after reset!

- there is no explosion on the final hit
- the background isnt blue when you hit him in the dark. needs more feedback.
- could increase artillery hp
- the AI needs some thinking!
- we need a restart option that appears when you win.
- he shoots himself on occassion.
- he hit my artillery and then it disappeared...

## Project Name: Shoot and Scoot HTML game
A strategy web game. The user plays against the computer taking turns to move their units and shoot. The game is a little bit similar to battleships. The artillery unit is hidden but its location is revealed upon firing. You can then move away one square. The scout can also be used to try and find the enemy artillery. If the artillery is hit, it dies and the game is over.

## Motivation
I wanted to improve my web design skills, especially my understanding of JavaScript, whilst also trying something new. I had this idea when I was making terminal games using Python.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project features
- fully mobile responsive
- smooth movement animations for units

## Lessons learnt
- how to make a game with JavaScript
- how to move elements smoothly around the screen
- it may have been better to use a grid with x and y coordinates, rather than a big list of numbers

## future development

- improve computer AI
- both scout and artillery are hidden
- scout can be destroyed
- more units
- other types of unit
- could fog of war be visible?
- limit the start location of the units or have defined starting points
- give unit weapons range
- hexagonal grid

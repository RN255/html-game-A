# Shoot and Scoot HTML game

HTML game - play at: https://rn255.github.io/html-game-A/

## Ideas for further development - second game

### gameplay

- improve computer AI
- both scout and artillery are hidden
- scout can be destroyed
- more units
- other types of unit
- could fog of war be visible?
- limit the start location of the units
- have defined starting points
- give unit weapons range
- 3d grid?
- hexagonal grid

### coding

- using classes would make it easier, especially with more units
- using a grid with X and Y instead of numbers 0 to 99
